In TypeScript, you can add two numbers by following these simple steps:

1. First, make sure that you have TypeScript installed. You can install it via npm using:

```
npm install -g typescript
```

2. Create a TypeScript file (e.g., add_numbers.ts) and open it in your favorite text editor.

3. In the add_numbers.ts file, type the following code to add two numbers:

```typescript
function addNumbers(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}

const number1: number = 5;
const number2: number = 7;
const sum: number = addNumbers(number1, number2);

console.log(`The sum of ${number1} and ${number2} is ${sum}`);
```

The code above defines a function `addNumbers(x: number, y: number): number`, which takes two input numbers and returns their sum. Then, two numbers `number1` and `number2` are added together, and the result is stored in the `sum` variable. Lastly, the console.log function is used to log the result.

4. Save your changes in the add_numbers.ts file.

5. Open your terminal, navigate to the file's location, and compile the TypeScript file:

```
tsc add_numbers.ts
```

This command will create a new JavaScript file called add_numbers.js.

6. To run the compiled JavaScript, use the following command:

```
node add_numbers.js
```

The output should display the sum of the two numbers you entered in the code.
