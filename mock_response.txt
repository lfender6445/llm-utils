In Python, you can add two numbers simply by using the addition operator (+). Here's an example:

```python
# Adding two numbers in Python
number1 = 5
number2 = 3

sum = number1 + number2

print('The sum of the two numbers is:', sum)
```

In this example, you would replace `number1` and `number2` with the numbers you want to add. The `sum` variable holds the result of the addition, and the `print()` function displays the result.
